## Probability & Statistics – Foundations

This repository is my learning journey into Probability and Statistics, built step by step with a focus on intuition, clarity, and strong foundations.

I am studying probability and statistics as core building blocks for Data Science, machine learning, and analytical thinking.

#### The goal is to understand:
- what is happening
- why and how it works
- how it connects to real data problems in reality
- to connect math with real data and code
- to document my learning clearly

This repo grows as I learn :-)

#### How I’m Learning: 
- Concepts first, formulas later
- Simple examples before generalization
- Discrete → continuous → distributions
- Math supported by Python simulations
- Clear explanations with comments and visuals as much as possible.

#### Folder Structure:
Each folder focuses on one idea at a time.

| **Folder**                  | **Description**                               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 01_probability_basics       | Sample space, events, basic probability rules |
| 02_random_variables         | Discrete and continuous random variables      |
| 03_distributions            | Common probability distributions              |
| 04_descriptive_statistics   | Mean, variance, standard deviation, shape     |
| 05_probability_theory_tools | Expectation, covariance, correlation          |
| 06_simulation_and_intuition | Simulations to build intuition                |
| 07_exercises                | Practice problems and self-checks             |

#### Tools Used :
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (when needed)
- Jupyter Notebooks

#### Current Focus: 
1. Probability fundamentals
   
#### Next Steps:

1. Random variables
2. Discrete vs continuous thinking
3. Probability distributions
4. Expectation and variance
5. Linking statistics with real datasets
